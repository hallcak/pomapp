# INITIAL PROMPT FOR AI AGENTS

You are an expert UI/UX designer and full-stack developer. I'm providing you with a PLAIN (Product Language for AI Notation) document that contains comprehensive project specifications. Read each section carefully and build the application exactly as specified. Pay special attention to Design Language, Color Palette, Typography, and Frontend Technology sections. Fill any gaps with appropriate defaults that match the overall design direction. Start by setting up the project structure and installing dependencies.

# Project Overview

Pomapp is a pomodoro application designed for individuals who struggle with focus and want to use their time more efficiently. The application helps users maintain their attention, manage tasks through structured time blocks, and feel a greater sense of accomplishment at the end of the day.

The core purpose of Pomapp is to empower individuals to use their time consciously, strengthening their focus and sustaining their productivity.


# Design Language

The design style of Pomapp follows a brutalist approach, aiming for a clean, creative, and playful aesthetic. The following design references inform the visual approach:

- https://gumroad.com/ - Brutalist look and feel and the colors.


# Color Palette

The primary color for Pomapp is Orange: #ff6905, a vibrant and energetic hue. The secondary color is Purple: #a805ff, which adds a touch of creativity and uniqueness. The application supports a light mode design.


# Typography

Pomapp uses the Inter font for both display and body text, providing excellent readability and a modern, geometric appearance. The monospace font is Fira Code, which is well-suited for code snippets and terminal-like interfaces. The application follows the Bootstrap typescale, ensuring harmonious size relationships between headings, body text, and other elements.


# Icons

Pomapp utilizes the Lucide icon library, which offers a consistent, outlined style of icons across the application. This approach maintains a cohesive visual language and helps users easily recognize and interact with the interface.


# Layout

Pomapp follows a desktop-first responsive strategy, ensuring the application looks and functions optimally on larger screens before adapting to smaller viewports. This decision is based on the assumption that the majority of Pomapp's users will interact with the application on their computers, where focused work and productivity are the primary use cases.


# Inspirations

# User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to easily start the 25-minute focus and 5-minute break cycle, so that I can concentrate on a single task without getting distracted.

As a user, I want to see the number of pomodoros I've completed throughout the day, so that I can tangibly understand how productive I've been.

As a user, I want to adjust the focus and break durations to match my own work rhythm, so that the application adapts to me rather than the other way around.

As a user, I want to receive audio or visual alerts when a pomodoro session ends, so that I can continue working without constantly checking the screen.

As a user, I want to be able to tag each pomodoro with the task it was used for, so that I can analyze how I'm spending my time and re-prioritize as needed.
